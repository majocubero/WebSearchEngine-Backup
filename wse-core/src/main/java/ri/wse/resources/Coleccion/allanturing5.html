 Alan Mathison Turing was one of the great pioneers of the computer

field.  He inspired the now common terms of &quot;The Turing Machine&quot;

and &quot;Turing's Test.&quot;  As a mathematician he applied

the concept of the algorithm to digital computers.  His research

into the relationships between machines and nature created the

field of artificial intelligence.  His intelligence and foresight

made him one of the first to step into the information age.

<P>

 Alan Turing was born in London on June 23, 1912.  As soon as

he began attending school, his aptitude for the sciences began

to emerge.  When it came to the more 'right brain' topics of English

and history however, his attention waned.  His instructors attempted

to get Alan to study other disciplines, but he would respond to

mathematics and science.  He retained this trait throughout his

education.

<P>

 He began his career in mathematics at King's College, Cambridge

University in 1931.  It was here that his tendencies to recreate

previous discoveries began to emerge.  Turing seemed to have little

interest in using the work of previous scientists; he would typically

spend time recreating their work instead.  Upon graduation, Turing

was made a fellow of King's College, and then moved on to Princeton

University.  It was during this time that he explored what was

later called the &quot;Turing Machine.&quot;  

<P>

 Turing helped pioneer the concept of the digital computer.  The

Turing Machine that he envisioned is essentially the same as today's

multi-purpose computers.  He described a machine that would read

a series of ones and zeros from a tape.  These ones and zeros

described the steps that needed to be done to solve a particular

problem or perform a certain task.  The Turing Machine would read

each of the steps and perform them in sequence, resulting in the

proper answer.  

<P>

 This concept was revolutionary for the time.  Most computers

in the 1950's were designed for a particular purpose or a limited

range of purposes.  What Turing envisioned was a machine that

could do anything, something that we take for granted today. 

The method of instructing the computer was very important in Turing's

concept.  He essentially described a machine which knew a few

simple instructions.  Making the computer perform a particular

task was simply a matter of breaking the job down into a series

of these simple instructions.  This is identical to the process

programmers go through today.  He believed that an algorithm could

be developed for most any problem.  The hard part was determining

what the simple steps were and how to break down the larger problems.

<P>

 During World War II, Turing used his knowledge and ideas in the

Department of Communications in Great Britain.  There he used

his mathematical skills to decipher the codes the Germans were

using to communicate.  This was an especially difficult task because

the Germans had developed a type of computer called the Enigma.

 It was able to generate a constantly changing code that was impossible

for the code breakers to decipher in a timely fashion.

<P>

 During his time with the Department of Communications in Great

Britain, Turing and his fellow scientists worked with a device

called COLOSSUS.  The COLOSSUS quickly and efficiently deciphered

the German codes created by the Enigma.  COLOSSUS was essentially

a bunch of servomotors and metal, but it was one of the first

steps toward the digital computer.

<P>

 After World War II, Turing found he needed a way to relieve the

stress he had been experiencing and took up long distance running.

 Much like everything else he enjoyed, he discovered he was quite

good at it.  He obtained record times in both the 3 and 10 mile

races in the Walton Athletic Club.  Typical of his logical nature,

his sometimes used his athletic ability to run between locations

for his lectures.

<P>

 Turing went on to work for the National Physical Laboratory (NPL)

and continued his research into digital computers.  Here he worked

on developing the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the

first attempts at creating a true digital computer.  It was during

this time that he began to explore the relationship between computers

and nature.  He wrote a paper called &quot;Intelligent Machinery&quot;

which was later published in 1969.  This was one of the first

times the concept of artificial intelligence was raised.

<P>

 Turing believed that machines could be created that would mimic

the processes of the human brain.  He discussed the possibility

of such machines, acknowledging the difficulty people would have

accepting a machine that would rival their own intelligence, a

problem that still plagues artificial intelligence today.  In

his mind, there was nothing the brain could do that a well designed

computer could not.  As part of his argument, Turing described

devices already in existence that worked like parts of the human

body, such as television cameras and microphones.

<P>

 Turing often got into heated debates with other scientists regarding

his radical views of the future of computing.  From our point

of view, the ideas he had are logical and are anything but surprising.

 From the point of view of his peers at the time, his ideas were

outlandish.  An interesting rebuttal Turing would use during such

a debate was to ask his colleague if they could create an examination

that a computer could not be trained to answer.  A computer would

have no problem with a multiple choice exam, however an essay

test would seem to be out of the range of a computer, however

this just further indicates Turing's accurate predictions.  There

is software available today that allows computers to write essays

given only a few guidelines and keywords.

<P>

 Turing believed that an intelligent machine could be created

by following the blueprints of the human brain.  He wrote a paper

in 1950 describing what is now known as the &quot;Turing Test.&quot;

 The test consisted of a person asking questions via keyboard

to both a person and an intelligent machine.  He believed that

if the person could not tell the machine apart from the person

after a reasonable amount of time, the machine was somewhat intelligent.

 This test has become the 'holy grail' of the artificial intelligence

community.  Turing's paper describing the test has been used in

countless journals and papers relating to machine intelligence.

 The 1987 edition of the <U>Oxford Companion to the Mind</U> describes

the Turing test as &quot;the best test we have for confirming

the presence of intelligence in a machine.&quot; (Crockett p.1)

 

<P>

 Even more recently, The Computer Museum of Boston hosted the

Loebner Prize Competition in November 1991.  The software developers

were tasked with developing a program that could pass a scaled

down version of the Turing test.  Modified in that the machines

were only required to converse on a limited topic.  The only problem

with the value of this test lies in the semantics of artificial

intelligence.  One has to distinguish between software that is

programmed to appear intelligent versus one that actually has

intelligence.  Determining where one begins and ends is a problem

best left to philosophers.

<P>

 Turing left the National Physical Laboratory before the completion

of the Automatic Computing Engine and moved on to the University

of Manchester.  There he worked on the development of the Manchester

Automatic Digital Machine (MADAM).  He truly believed that machines

would be created by the year 2000 that could replicate the human

mind.  Turing worked toward this end by creating algorithms and

programs for the MADAM.  He worked to create the operating manual

for the MADAM and became one of the main users of MADAM to further

his research.

<P>

 One major aspect of Turing's life that often goes unnoticed is

his work in biology.  Turing only published one paper, entitled

<U>The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis</U> in 1952.  He had written

a number of other papers, but none were finished before his death.

 These have since been published in draft form.  Turing's main

focus in biology was the physical structure of living things.

 He was interested in how and why organisms developed particular

shapes.  There are millions of cells in a person or a tree, and

yet all know what shape to be.  Turing wanted to figure out why.

<P>

 An important foundation of his research was the 'argument from

design.' (Saunders)  The basic idea behind this first came around

when people still believed that there was an all powerful being

that had sculpted every living thing.  How else could all these

organisms have gotten their various physical traits that allow

them to exist in their particular environment?  The theory of

god's intervention was replaced by Darwin's idea of natural selection

before Turing became involved, but the concept still works.  The

structure is being determined by outside intervention.

<P>

 Turing did not subscribe to this theory.  He was influenced greatly

by the biologist D'Arcy Thompson who believed that biological

form was simply a result of chemical and physical processes. 

The selection of the structure does not come into play until the

possible forms have been determined.  The basic bottom line for

Turing's position was, &quot;Instead of asking why a certain arrangement

of leaves is especially advantageous to a plant, he tried to show

that it was a natural consequence of the process by which the

leaves are produced.&quot;  

<P>

 He was using a very precise mathematical approach to the problem.

 This gives some insight into his strong belief in the close relation

between nature and math.  Turing's ultimate goal was to merge

already established biological theory with mathematics and computers

to create his intelligent, multi-purpose machine.  He saw the

development of these leaves as nothing more than a simple set

of steps, an algorithm.  This matched the basic concept of his

'Turing Machine.'

<P>

 Turing died on June 7, 1954 from what the medical examiners described

as, &quot;self-administered potassium cyanide while in a moment

of mental imbalance.&quot;  Other reasons for his death have surfaced.

 His mother claimed that he used to experiment with household

chemicals, trying to create new substances and became careless.

 Others claim he was homosexual and killed himself to prevent

embarrassment.

<P>

 Whatever the reason for his death, Turing was truly one of the

great forerunners in the field of computers.  Today's computer

scientists still refer to his papers.  The concept of the algorithm

lies at the heart of every computer program for any type of digital

computer.  It is very conceivable that his idea of thinking machines

by the year 2000 is not too far from the truth.<HR>
